QUICK FIX FOR VERCEL CACHING ISSUE
=====================================

YOUR PROBLEM: Changes pushed to GitHub but production URL shows old content

YOUR SOLUTION - DO THIS NOW:

1. Open Vercel Dashboard: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click your project: "pms-seven-fawn"
3. Go to Settings tab → Build & Deployment
4. Scroll down and click "Clear Cache" (red button)
5. Confirm the prompt
6. Wait 30 seconds
7. Go to Deployments tab
8. Find latest deployment
9. Click ... menu → "Redeploy"
10. Choose "Redeploy with cache cleared"
11. Wait 2-3 minutes for build
12. Once "Ready" status appears:
    - Go to https://pms-seven-fawn.vercel.app/dashboard
    - Hard Refresh: Ctrl+Shift+Delete (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+Delete (Mac)
    - Verify changes appear

WHAT WAS FIXED:
✓ Cache busting configuration added
✓ index.html now always fresh (max-age=0)
✓ Assets versioned with content hashes
✓ Browser cache properly invalidated
✓ Future deployments will auto-update

WHY IT WASN'T WORKING BEFORE:
- index.html was being cached by browser
- New code was there, but old HTML was served
- Assets weren't properly versioned

AFTER THIS FIX:
Every time you push to GitHub:
→ Vercel builds automatically
→ Changes appear immediately in production
→ No more stale content issues

FILES CHANGED FOR THIS FIX:
- vercel.json (cache headers)
- vite.config.js (build output hashing)
- DEPLOYMENT_FIX.md (detailed documentation)
